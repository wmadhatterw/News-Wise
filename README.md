<h2>News That's Wise</h2>
<h3>(KU-Coding BootCamp Project 2)</h3>

Utilizing BCrypt, Passport, Sequelize, Express, and Handlebars we aimed to create a website 
with the explicit goal being to change up how you can consume and interact with news content.
By decentralizing news and repositioning the publishing power to the user, we allow editorial 
control of the news to shift into multiple sources hands, the quality and varacity of which
ever increasing as the user base grows.
